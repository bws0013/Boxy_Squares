What is the minimum number of squares that must be filled in on a sudoku board before a 'dumb' program for solving it can solve it?

This program is part 1 of this problem. This is the required dumb program.

Each square of the board will run on its own thread and will constantly check if it is certain of its own value. Once the board fills and/or the max number of squares have been filled with their value the simulation ends.
